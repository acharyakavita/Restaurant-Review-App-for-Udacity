# Using the Application
The Restaurant Review App is simple to use: You are provided with a map and filtering options. Select the neighborhood in New York City and the type of cuisine you are interested in from the drop down selectors. The options will be filtered based on your preferences, and the map will update as well with your selections. Once your options are provided below, as restaurant cards with a photo, you can select one to view more information. A full photo, a map, and all the reviews will be provided for the selected restaurant. There is a breadcrumb navigation near the top of this view to return to the selection screen. Easy as that!
